This is my attempt to reimplement the work discussed in [Computer Graphics from
Scratch](https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch).

Note that this is very much *not* idiomatic Go, instead opting to follow the
implementation details of the book to make it easier to follow.  That means we
pass around arrays (for example) instead of a proper point struct.
